- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library




### What I learned

This project was great at teaching me about design systems, i was able to use one to help make the project run alot more smoother especially when it came to the CSS.
this project also allowed me to create a website mobile-first which really put responsive design at the forefront and meant less time was spent trying to tweak the design at the end to be responsive.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

## Continued Development

I would like to continue this project and incorporate 3-d models using 3js in the future to really help this project look and feel more interactice.
